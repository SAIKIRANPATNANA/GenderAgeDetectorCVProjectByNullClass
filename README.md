```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAIKIRANPATNANA/GenderAgeDetectorCVProjectByNullClass
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd GenderAgeDetectorCVProjectByNullClass
```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. After installing the required dependencies, run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```bash
